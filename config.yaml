    subtitle: Cloud-Based Data Science (CBDS) consists of two parts. One, a set of pay-what-you-want (including free!) massive open online courses that can be completed on any computer with a web browser and an internet connection. 
    subtitle2: Two, Cloud-Based Data Science Plus (CBDS+) is a no-cost, paid 14-week educational initiative for young-adult, high school and GED-graduates in Baltimore City. Offered by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in partnership with the Historic East Baltimore Community Action Coalition and Leanpub, CBDS+ aims to equip members of surrounding communities with the necessary skills and support required to work in the booming field of data science.
    subtitle3: We aim to equip individuals from underserved populations with the necessary skills and support required to work in the field of data science. A poriton of anything you pay for the online courses supports the CBDS+ program.
